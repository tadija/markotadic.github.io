**TweetPlay** for iOS made its debut in 2017, with its initial prototype dating back to 2015. It stands as a personal "tweet wall" where users simply hit play and enjoy full-screen tweets. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

*Fun fact: the app's interface, designed as a "story-like" experience using tweets for content, predated Instagram's introduction of the "Stories" feature in 2016. üòé*

Unfortunately, when Elon Musk acquired Twitter and closed its API in February 2023, this app, along with many other Twitter client apps, became part of history. As a consequence, Twitter is no longer fun ‚Äî it's not even Twitter anymore; now, it's just called X. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
