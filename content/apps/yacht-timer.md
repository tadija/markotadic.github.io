The **Yacht Timer** iOS app, initially released in 2014, serves as a regatta start timer and is a result of a collaboration with the sailing club [JK ADA](https://jk-ada.com) ‚õµÔ∏è.

To kick off the project, my friend (also a sailing instructor at JK ADA) and I organized a weekend hackathon. Our first steps included crafting a distinctive logo üé®, securing the domain [yachttimer.com](https://yachttimer.com), and, as envisioned, developing the iOS app üì±.

The initial version was written in Objective-C and impressively remained functional without any updates for seven years! :) Throughout this period, the app scored downloads and users from all around the world. üåé

In 2021, I rebuilt the app from scratch using Swift and SwiftUI. This update brought several enhancements, including support for iPads, VoiceOver, Haptic Feedback, Dark & Light appearances, and more.

Here are a few screenshots showcasing the app's features:
