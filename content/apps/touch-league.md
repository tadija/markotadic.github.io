**Touch League** for iOS, first released in 2016, is a simple local multiplayer game where two players compete in tap speed, but with a twist: only a single tap at a time counts. ü§å The challenge lies in synchronizing fingers and finding a rhythm so that each tap occurs at a different point in time. ‚è±Ô∏è

Each game lasts only 10 seconds, yet I've witnessed players achieving over 150 taps in that short period. ü§Ø

Here's a recording of a match featuring one of the first serious high scores (140), captured during the [spark.me](https://spark.me) conference in 2016. üéÜ

And here's a glimpse of me, just before that conference, capturing screenshots for the initial release of "Touch League."
